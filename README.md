# KitchenKitApi
This is a .NET 8 version of the KitchenKit API originally written in python.

KitchenKit is a mobile application created for a school project. The purpose of KitchenKit was to help users
manage their recipes in the form of a simple mobile cookbook. With KitchenKit users can create, update, delete, or even 
mark their favorite recipes to ease in finding them in the future. On top of that KitchenKit also allows for the creation
of a meal plan allowing the user to plan their meals day, weeks, or even months in advance.


The complete application  consists of a mobile app created using the Flutter framework which is in communication 
with an API used to handle and store all data. The original API was written in python using the Django framework. This API
is a .NET 8 version of that original API. The functionality of this variant has been kept as close to the original as possible, to reduce
the amount of work needed to integrate it with the front-end as much as possible.
